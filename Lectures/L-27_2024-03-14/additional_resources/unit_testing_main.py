# Plan of the tutorial:

# 1. How to write tests
# 2. How to setup and tear down your tests
# 3. Review some best practices

# A good test saves a lot of time and headache down the road.

# When you write good tests for your code, it gives you more 
# confidence that your updates and refactoring don't have any 
# unintended consequences or break your code in any way. So,
# for example, if you update a function in your project, 
# those changes may have actually broken down several 
# sections of your code even if that function itself 
# is still working. Good unit tests will make sure everything 
# is working as it should if it's not then it will show exactly 
# what's broken.

# In this tutorial will cover the built-in unittesting module:
# unittest
